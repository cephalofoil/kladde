# Collaboration

Kladde supports real-time collaboration so multiple people can work on the same
board simultaneously.

## How it works

- Board state updates are broadcast through PartyKit.
- `src/lib/collaboration.ts` coordinates awareness and document syncing.
- The UI reflects live cursors and edits as updates arrive.

## Relevant files

- `src/lib/collaboration.ts`
- `party/index.ts`
- `src/store/board-sync-store.ts`

## Tips

- Validate connection events in PartyKit logs when debugging.
- Use smaller tiles for high-frequency updates to keep sync smooth.
