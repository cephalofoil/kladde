# Exporting Boards

Kladde can export boards into shareable formats for reviews or archiving.

## Export types

- PDF snapshots
- Image assets
- Structured data exports

## Implementation notes

Export logic is centralized in `src/lib/document-export.tsx`. It reads the board
state, renders output, and keeps the active board intact.

## Common workflow

1. Open the board you want to export.
2. Choose an export type from the UI.
3. Review the preview and save the output file.
