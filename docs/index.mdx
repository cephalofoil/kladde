# Kladde Documentation

Kladde is a modular working canvas for sketching ideas, planning workstreams, and
capturing knowledge in boards. This documentation covers the core concepts,
feature workflows, and the key APIs used across the app.

## What you can do

- Create boards that mix drawings, text, diagrams, and files.
- Organize boards into workstreams and return to recent boards quickly.
- Export boards to shareable formats such as PDF.
- Collaborate in real time with synced cursors and updates.

## Repo map

- `src/app` contains the Next.js routes and layouts.
- `src/components` holds reusable UI building blocks.
- `src/lib` contains shared utilities (export, storage, collaboration, etc.).
- `src/store` is the state layer for boards and sync.

## Next up

Head to the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide to understand how
boards are structured and how data flows through the app.
