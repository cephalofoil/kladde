# Getting Started

This guide introduces the main moving parts of Kladde so you can navigate the
codebase and understand the user experience quickly.

## Core concepts

### Boards

Boards are the primary workspace. They contain tiles like drawings, text blocks,
and files. Board state is stored in `src/store` and serialized via utilities in
`src/lib`.

### Workstreams

Workstreams group related boards. The sidebar surfaces recent and favorite
boards for faster switching.

### Tiles

Tiles are the modular units inside a board. They power text, code blocks,
diagrams, and sketches. Helpers for tile behavior live in `src/lib/tile-utils.ts`.

## Key flows

1. A user opens a board via `src/app` routes.
2. Board data is loaded through the store in `src/store`.
3. Tiles render through components in `src/components`.
4. Changes persist locally and can sync through collaboration utilities.

## Helpful entry points

- `src/app/page.tsx` for the primary landing experience.
- `src/components/header.tsx` for navigation and board switching.
- `src/lib/document-export.tsx` for exporting boards.
