# Boards API

This page documents the primary board-related data structures and utilities.

## Board types

Board types live in `src/lib/board-types.ts` and `src/lib/store-types.ts`.
They define the tile schema, metadata, and serialization format.

## Store APIs

Board state is managed in `src/store/board-store.ts` and related sync stores.
Use these for creating, updating, or deleting boards.

## Export helpers

`src/lib/document-export.tsx` consumes board data to generate output formats.
When adding new export types, follow the existing helper patterns in that file.
